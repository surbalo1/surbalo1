## 👋 About Me

Hey! I’m Rafael — a firmware engineer focused on **embedded systems, IoT, and low-power devices**.  

I enjoy digging into registers, optimizing code for power efficiency, and making hardware and software work seamlessly together.  
Outside of work, I like experimenting with embedded ML, debugging boards, and automating small hardware tools.

🎓 I also completed the **Global Summer Institute (Big Data & AI)** at **UT Austin**, where I worked on applied ML projects and earned top marks in Python and AI modules.

**Current focus:** low-power firmware • BLE & IoT protocols • embedded ML • real-time debugging
